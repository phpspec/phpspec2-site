Spec BDD with phpspec
=====================

**phpspec** is a development tool, designed to help you achieve clean and
working PHP code by using a technique derived from test-first development
called (spec) behaviour driven developement, or SpecBDD.

The technique consists in describing the next object behaviour you are about
to implement, using a tool like **phpspec**, then writing just enough code
that satisfies that specification (spec), then refactoring the last increment.
This is done in small iterative steps.

Installation
------------

**phpspec** is a php 5.3 library that you'll use inside your project
development environment. Before you begin, ensure that you have at least
PHP 5.3.1 installed.

Method #1 (Composer)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The simplest way to install phpspec with all its dependencies is through
Composer:

Create ``composer.json`` file in the project root:

.. code-block:: js
    
    {
        "require-dev": {
            "phpspec/phpspec2": "*"
        },
        "config": {
            "bin-dir": "bin"
        },
        "autoload": {"psr-0": {"": "src"}},
        "minimum-stability": "dev"
    }

Then download ``composer.phar`` and run ``install`` command:

.. code-block:: bash

    $ curl http://getcomposer.org/installer | php
    $ php composer.phar install --dev

Everything will be installed inside ``vendor`` folder and executable will
be linked into ``bin`` folder.

SpecBDD and TDD
---------------

There isn't any real difference between SpecBDD and TDD. The value of using
a xSpec tool instead a regular xUnit tool for TDD is language. The concepts
and features of the tool will keep you focus on the "right" things. Focus
on verification and structure as opposed to behaviour and design are, of
course, valid ones. We happen to find that the later ones are more valuable.
They were also the intention of early users of TDD.

SpecBDD and StoryBDD
--------------------

While with StoryBDD tools like [Behat](http://behat.org) are used to
understand and clarify the domain specifying feature naratives, its need and
what do we mean by them, with SpecBDD we are only focused on the how, the
implementation. You are specifying how your classes will achieve those
features.

A good StoryBDD will let the business talk the domain language and drive the
development by putting the focus on what really matters first.

Once you know what and why you are adding a feature it's time to write code.
But not yet! Adding code without a way to validate it serves the specs just
mean you will have to get back and make it do just that. And the later you
find out you missed the requirement or added a bug the harder and expensive
it is to do that. Kent Beck also adds that describing the code before you
actually write it is a fear management technique. You don't have to write all
the code, just the spec of the next thing you want to work on. That executable
spec will then guide you to what code you need to write. Once you did that
than what you have is a chance to refactor. Because if you change the
behaviour of your code the specs will go red. So you spec so that you can
refactor, emerge the design of your code, sustainably. SpecBDD tools are
designed to guide you in the process.

It's valid to assume that StoryBDD and SpecBDD used together is a very
effective way to achieve highly customer focused software.

Getting Started
---------------

Say we are building a tool that converts
(Markdown)[en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown] into HTML. Well, that's a large
task. But I work on simple things first and emerge the design to reach all
the necessary features. Even though I have all the specs from the customer
(we have done all our Behat feature files), I know I will discover things I
will need to make sure are there as I sit to write my classes.

What is the simple thing I want to add? It should convert a string line into a
HTML marked up paragraph, i.e. `"Hi, there"` becomes `"<p>Hi, there</p>"`.

So let's do it. Well, not the boring bits. Let's **phpspec** take care of the
boring stuff for us. We just need to tell **phpspec** we will be working on
the `Markdown` class.

.. code-block:: bash

    $ bin/phpspec describe Markdown
    Specification for Markdown created in spec.

You can also specify a fully qualified class name. Don't forget that if you
use backslashes you need to pass the class name inside double quotes.
Alternatively you could use forward slashes and skip the quotes. **phpspec**
will create the folder structure following PSR standards.

Ok. What have we just done? **phpspec** has created the spec for us. You can
navigate to the spec folder and see the spec there:

.. code-block:: php

    <?php

    namespace spec;

    use PHPSpec2\ObjectBehavior;

    class Markdown extends ObjectBehavior
    {
        function it_should_be_initializable()
        {
            $this->shouldHaveType('Markdown');
        }
    }

That's awesome! **phpspec** created the spec for me. I only need to update
that first example to match my intention.

.. code-block:: php

    class Markdown extends ObjectBehavior
    {
        function it_converts_plain_text_to_html_paragraphs()
        {
            $this->toHtml("Hi, there")->shouldReturn("<p>Hi, there</p>");
        }
    }

Now what? We run the specs. You may not believe this, but **phpspec** will
understand we are describing a class that doesn't exist and offer to create
it!

.. code-block:: bash

    $ bin/phpspec run 

    > spec\Markdown

      ✘ it converts plain text to html paragraphs
          Class Markdown does not exists.

             Do you want me to create it for you? [Y/n]

**phpspec** will then place the empty class in the directory. You run your
spec again and... OK, you guessed:

.. code-block:: bash

    $ bin/phpspec run 
    
    > spec\Markdown
    
      ✘ it converts plain text to html paragraphs
          Method Markdown::toHtml() not found.
    
             Do you want me to create it for you? [Y/n]

What we just did was moving fast through the ambar state into the red.

.. code-block:: php

    <?php
    
    class Markdown
    {
    
        public function toHtml()
        {
            // TODO: implement
        }
    }

We got rid of the fatal errors and ugly messages resulting of unexisting
classes and methods and went straight into a real failed spec:

.. code-block:: bash

    $ bin/phpspec run 
    
    > spec\Markdown
    
      ✘ it converts plain text to html paragraphs
          Expected "<p>Hi, there</p>", but got null.
    
    
    1 examples (1 failed)
    284ms

According to the TDD rules we know have full permission to write code. Red
means "time to add code", red is great! Now we add just enough code to make
the spec green, quickly. There will be time to get it right, but first just
get it green.

.. code-block:: php

    class Markdown
    {
    
        public function toHtml()
        {
            return "<p>Hi, there</p>";
        }
    }

And voilà:

.. code-block:: bash

    $ bin/phpspec run 
    
    > spec\Markdown
    
      ✔ it converts plain text to html paragraphs
    
    1 examples (1 passed)
    247ms

I will leave the explanation of the whole TDD/SpecBDD cycle for a blog posts.

Prophet Objects
---------------

Stubs
~~~~~

When you describing your object you want to keep your focus just there in the
object. You don't want to wander off to start describing collaborators. You
can very easily tell **phpspec** that there will be collaborators and stub
their behaviour so you can describe your object message exchange with them.

.. code-block:: php

    namespace spec\Markdown\Formatter;

    use PHPSpec2\Specification;

    class EndOfListFormatter extends ObjectBehavior
    {
        /**
         * @param Markdown\Stream $stream
         */
        function it_adds_a_end_of_list_to_markup($stream)
        {
            $stream->getNextLine()->willReturn("");
            $this->format(" * Hi, there", $stream)->shouldReturn("</li></ul>");
        }
    }

To stub the behaviour of ``Markdown\Stream::getNextLine()`` we just need to
pass it to the example, using widely used phpdoc notation, and configuring
the stub is merely stating what it should return: ``->willReturn("")``.

Mocks
~~~~~

In addition you will need to make sure a message was sent to an collaborator
during the normal execution of your methods.

.. code-block:: php

    namespace spec;

    use PHPSpec2\Specification;

    class MyObject extends ObjectBehavior
    {
        /**
         * @param SomeEvent $event
         * @param SomeSubscriber $subscriber
         */
        function it_formats_the_string_as_a_header_if_underline_with_single_dashes($event, $subscriber)
        {
            $subscriber->onChange($event)->shouldBeCalled();
            
            // when
            $this->addSubscriber($subcriber);
            $this->doWhatever($event);
        }
    }

Let and Let Go
--------------

**phpspec** implements the symmetric setup and tear down using the `let` and
`letgo` methods.

.. code-block:: php

    class EverChangingWorld extends ObjectBehavior
    {
        function let($die)
        {
            $die->beAMockOf('Die');
            $this->beConstructedWith($die);
        }
        
        function it_live_and_let_die($die)
        {
            $this->liveAndLet()->shouldReturn($die);
        }
        
        function letgo()
        {
            // release any resource
            // put the system back into the state it was before the example
        }
    }
